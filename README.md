The math and utilities for [B+](https://github.com/heyx3/B-plus). Refer to the main repo for documentation.

The modules contained here are:

* ECS
* Fields
* SceneTree

If you want just this package (and BplusCore), without the rest of B+, you can add this package directly to your project and then do `using BplusTools; @using_bplus_tools`.
